# GrandOptical_LunettesdeVue

This project uses scrapy to get info about [Lunettes de vue](https://www.grandoptical.com/toutes-nos-lunettes/lunettes-de-vue/c/59/) offered by [GrandOptical](https://www.grandoptical.com/). This is a good starting project for anyone interested in getting started with scrapy and XPath. 

Don't be put off by the so many files existing in the projects. While all these files are necessory to run the spider, they are autogenerated and only the file [lunettes_bu.py](https://github.com/chsafouane/GrandOptical_LunettesdeVue/blob/master/grandoptical_lv/spiders/lunettes_vue.py) was modified.

The [json file](https://github.com/chsafouane/GrandOptical_LunettesdeVue/blob/master/grandoptical.json) at the root directory contains the result of the scraping operation.

After installing scrapy, one has to use the following commands to initiate the project:

1- Generate the project: **scrapy startproject grandoptical_lv**: This command will create all the files necessary for the project.

2- cd into the project folder

3- To create the spider [lunettes_bu](https://github.com/chsafouane/GrandOptical_LunettesdeVue/blob/master/grandoptical_lv/spiders/lunettes_vue.py), use this command **scrapy genspider lunttes_vue "www.grandoptical.com/toutes-nos-lunettes/lunettes-de-vue/c/59"**
